1/ [Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps)](https://github.com/vanthachvn80/data_science/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20Engineering%20for%20Production%20(MLOps))

* Identify the key components of the ML lifecycle and pipeline and compare the ML modeling iterative cycle with the ML product deployment cycle.

* Understand how performance on a small set of disproportionately important examples may be more crucial than performance on the majority of examples.

* Solve problems for structured, unstructured, small, and big data. Understand why label consistency is essential and how you can improve it.
